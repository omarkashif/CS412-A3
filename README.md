# **Collaborative Filtering with Deep Neural Networks**

This assignment implements two deep learning models for collaborative filtering recommendation tasks using the MovieLens 100k dataset. The dataset is converted from explicit ratings into implicit feedback by treating ratings of 4 and above as positive user-item interactions. Negative samples are generated by randomly sampling items that a user has not interacted with, enabling the models to distinguish positive interactions from negatives.

**Models**

Matrix Factorization (MF): A classical collaborative filtering technique that learns latent embeddings for users and items, combining them via dot product to estimate user-item interaction probability. This model serves as a baseline shallow embedding approach.

Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF): An extension of MF that uses multi-layer perceptrons (MLP) to model complex non-linear interactions between user and item embeddings, aiming to improve recommendation accuracy by learning richer representations.

**Evaluation**

The models are evaluated using ranking metrics commonly used in recommender systems research:

Recall@k: Measures the proportion of relevant items (positive interactions) found in the top-k recommendations for each user.

NDCG@k (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain): Takes into account the position of relevant items in the ranked list, giving higher scores to relevant items appearing higher in the list.

These metrics focus on ranking quality rather than rating prediction accuracy, aligning with typical collaborative filtering goals.


**Results**

The results show that the Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF) model significantly outperforms the Matrix Factorization (MF) model in both Recall@10 and NDCG@10 metrics. This indicates that NCF is better at accurately ranking relevant items higher in the recommendation list, demonstrating the advantage of deep learning approaches for collaborative filtering tasks.
